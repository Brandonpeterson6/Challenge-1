# Code Refactor Horiseon 
This repository shows the code for Horiseon Social Solutions Services landing page. It will show the changes that I made to the original code to follow the guidelines

The changes I was able to make were:
* give the html proper semantic elements.
* rearrange and conbime the CSS propers in a simpler easier to read document.
* made sure all the links function properly.
* added descriptive alt attributes where necessary.
